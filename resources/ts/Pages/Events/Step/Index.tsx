                    <Paragraph>STEP is run by Postal Bible School in Ireland. The attendees are drawn from across a range of denominations and independent Christian Fellowships. The focus of the weekends is to unpack God's word in a way that allows it to speak for itself. We have a united view that Christ is our central hope and the written Word of God is powerful in teaching us what is true and worthwhile.

                        <Paragraph >For longer than we can remember Postal Bible School has been running Summer Camps where young people come together for fun, fellowship and learning the Word of God. At a few times over the years there have been attempts to continue to provide that experience for those who were too old for camp but only as one off events. In the Summer of 2012, as a group of teens left their final year of camp the idea of a weekend together for teens and young adults was reborn. Since January 2013 we have been holding 3 weekend events each year. In the early days it was just 12-20 each weekend but that has now grown to as many as 70. As friends have brought others over the years the group has expanded to reflect an Irish focus with an International flavour. As we moved online during the pandemic past attendees from several countries and continents were able to join in the teaching sessions. In November 2021 we returned to in person events with our largest attendance to date despite a few restrictions.</Paragraph>
